              <i>4 May 2020</i> | The <a href="https://doi.org/10.21957/rcxqfmg0" target="_blank">"ERA5.1"</a> which is a rerun of ERA5 for the period from 2000 to 2006 is now publicly available. In ERA5.1, the cold bias in the lower stratosphere seen in ERA5 has been improved. ERA5.1 also has better representation of the upper stratospheric temperature and stratospheric humidity. The lower and middle troposphere in ERA5.1 are similar to those in ERA5. Access to ERA5.1 data is through the CDS API only using 'reanalysis-era5.1-complete' as per updated ERA5 complete data download guidelines - go to <a href="https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-StepC:DownloadERA5dataNOTlistedinCDSthroughCDSAPI" target="_blank">this link</a>.
